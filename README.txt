Driver AI:
This project is a demonstration of artificial intelligence and my personal take on driving AI. This game/environment/demo consists of a player car (the only blue car) in addition to CPU cars. The goal of this entire game is to make a left turn through the intersection losing as little points as possible. Everything is based on points, and doing anything that goes against proper driving will take off points.
Using neural networks, the user can choose the amount of iterations to train the AI before it goes through the intersection, and based on that the performance of it will vary.
The user can also choose Free Play mode, which will give the controls over from the AI to the user, and using WASD they can try out the environment themselves.

Getting Started:
Run the "driver.jar" file at the root of the directory (the same one as this README).
It's important to run the "driver.jar" file in the same directory as the "res" folder.

Built With:
Java and supporting Java libraries.
Photoshop to create the assets

Controls:
Main menu:
	Start button: Start the AI training and demo
	Left arrow: Decrease the training iteration count
	Box with numbers: Iterations
	Right arrow: Increase the training iteration count
	Check mark beside start button: Disable automatically increase the iteration by 5 after every attempt
	Freeplay: User takes control. 
Use WASD to drive around.
